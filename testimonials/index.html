          <div class="quote-icon">&ldquo;</div>
          <p>My family was in a very challenging place and even though I work full-time ends were not meeting. I'm a single mummy and we were not overspending on luxuries &mdash; those were cut out a long time ago. This was for basic living. However, no matter how many things we kept cutting, each month was still the same &mdash; not even breaking even.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 12px;">Through a dear friend Life Reach became aware of my family's situation and enabled us to avail of food. This had such an impact on everyday life &mdash; lunches for school, healthy snacks, bread, treats, and ingredients for full meals.</p>

          <p>That is exactly what this charity does, looks to help those most in need at all given times. There to support local people who have hit hard times and whereby the provision of varied food can make a massive difference to; it genuinely has to our family.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 12px;">Survival. Never did I see that being the place my family would be in but it's real, and for so many now in Northern Ireland. Living in a house where a coat, scarf, and hot water bottle are part of normal daily attire. It was-what-it-was and we accepted a very cold house and occasional hot water as part of everyday life.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 12px;">I'm a working mum and I don't overspend on my children but I do have big responsibilities &mdash; and was looking at a VERY cold winter ahead. However, Life Reach picked up on the situation, unbeknown to me worked on finding a solution, and through their charity did just that, the unbelievable. They enabled my family to have a heated house and warm running water through the amazing delivery of 500 litres of oil.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 12px;">Words simply do not do justice to the difference that made to my family in the run-up to and over Christmas. The shock of a radiator having a heat, washing hands frequently in running hot water, waking up to some heat in the house, and the ability to have a decent depth warm bath. Never did we think it was possible, but this charity did our impossible.</p>

          <p>Life Reach helped me when I had to move into temporary accommodation. Me and my children had to leave our home and had nothing. Life Reach provided me with furniture, meals and provided clothes for my children. They have been there to help and support us. We are so thankful for everything they have done for us.</p>
