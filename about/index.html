        <p>Life Reach was started in 2015 with the main intention to help and support people and communities who face struggles, brokenness, poverty, mental health, grief, social problems and life controlling issues.</p>
        <p>We exist to relieve suffering and promote the well-being of those people and their families who are suffering or experiencing mental or emotional distress and anguish as a result of mental illness, drug and alcohol addiction, suicide, social and/or economic circumstances, domestic abuse and/or violence and difficulties in their personal lives.</p>
        <p>Life Reach has helped communities through community fun days, Christmas parties and other initiatives that meet people's needs, bring people together and help those who are vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Due to the global pandemic that hit us in 2020 and the lockdown restrictions we were unable to do many of the usual activities &amp; initiatives which add value to people's lives. We became aware of people not being able to access necessities or meet the needs of their families. Life Reach partnered with Marks &amp; Spencers, Tesco and Co-op to provide food and essentials to those in need.</p>
        <p>Our volunteers grew as the need grew which enabled us to get food to most parts of Belfast and surrounding areas. We have also helped families who have had to move into temporary accommodation access furniture and have also partnered with organizations to provide not just food and sanitary needs but other essential items such as clothes.</p>
        <p>Since April 2020 to March 2023 we have given out over 385 thousand meals.</p>
        <p>All of this is possible because of the kind donations and giving from generous companies and individuals who support us and our work.</p>

            &ldquo;Without a doubt, this is one of the most rewarding things about my job. We started our working relationship with Lifereach around March 2020, and with them currently distributed over 500k worth of meals for people who need it. We have an amazing working relationship with Liam and the team. They are always consistently there to collect food when needed and I've got to say I'm really proud that when we come together we are helping others.&rdquo;
