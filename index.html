We started our working relationship with Lifereach around March 2020, and with them currently distributed over 500k worth of meals for people who need it. We have an amazing working relationship with Liam and the team. They are always consistently there to collect food when needed and I've got to say I'm really proud that when we come together we are helping others.&rdquo;
